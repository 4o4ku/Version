<p>Adds a bunch of new Enchantments, appropriate for both vanilla and modded gameplay. Also provides improved versions of lots of vanilla enchantments as well. Various properties for all of these can be configured in the ensorcellment-server.toml file which is <strong>unique to each world/server</strong>. (Sorry, this is a new thing with Forge in 1.14.)</p>

<p>For the most part, vanilla enchantment overrides simply allow the enchantment to apply to more items - Protection enchantments can apply to Horse Armor. Many sword-only enchantments can apply to Axes as well. Two enchantments with large changes, however are <strong>Mending</strong> and <strong>Frost Walker</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If the Mending override is enabled (<strong>disabled by default</strong>), Mending is replaced with Preservation - XP orbs no longer repair the item, but the item can be repaired (and only repaired, not upgraded) at an Anvil for no additional cost. Essentially, the stacking penalty is removed, and the item can last indefinitely but requires manual repair.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If the Frost Walker override is enabled (<strong>enabled by default</strong>), then Frost Walker will also work when on Horse Armor! There is an additional configuration option to allow Frost Walker to work on Lava blocks (for both Players and Horses), creating <strong>Glossed Magma</strong>:</em></p>
