<p><em><strong>Archer's Paradox</strong></em> adds a bunch of new arrows, appropriate for both lightly and heavily modded gameplay.</p>
<ul>
<li>This mod requires <em><strong>CoFH Core</strong></em>. It can be found here:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cofh-core">CoFH Core</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Various properties for all of these can be configured in the archers_paradox-server.toml file which is unique to each world/server. Copying this file to your /defaultsconfig folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diamond: 2x Damage, +1 Pierce, +1 Knockback</li>
<li>Prismarine: No water slowdown; reduced gravity in water.</li>
<li>Quartz: 1.25x Damage, +1 Knockback</li>
<li>Blaze: Burns target and ignites radius around it.</li>
<li>Frost: Chills target and freezes area around it.</li>
<li>Lightning: Calls down a lightning bolt, if it hits outside.</li>
<li>Ender: Teleports player to location; or swaps places with the target.</li>
<li>Explosive: This one is obvious.</li>
<li>Phantasmal: Flies through blocks, unlimited pierce, ignores gravity and armor. Glows.</li>
<li>Shulker: Homes in on a target; levitation status effect.</li>
<li>Slime: Ricochets and has lots of Knockback. (A personal favorite.)</li>
<li>Redstone: Generates a redstone signal in a large area for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Glowstone: Lights up an area for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Disruption: Creates a temporary area which teleports things away.</li>
<li>Spore: Transforms Dirt and Grass into Mycelium in an area.</li>
<li>Verdant: Transforms Dirt into Grass in an area. Also grows crops/plants.</li>
<li>Training: No damage, stacks a "Hit Streak" effect. Advancements (NYI). Distance matters!</li>
<li>Challenge: No damage, stacks "Archer's Gambit" effect. XP for maintaining hit streak. Distance matters!</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one creative tab, currently with only the arrows. More content (quivers, archery-themed blocks, etc) on the way!</p>
<p>For those of you who may recognize some of these icons from another archery themed mod - Bullseye - Forstride has very graciously given me permission to carry the quiver forward as it were. Frankly, we had a lot of similar ideas (although mechanically different execution) and Bullseye has excellent artwork that deserves to live on in 1.14+.</p>
