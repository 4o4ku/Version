CoFH Version Repository
====================================
#### Okay, so here's the deal.

This repository is for versioning information. It's a public-accessible place that our mods will be able to talk to. It's open for the sake of transparency and so that everyone knows that external connections that CoFH mods make from within Minecraft come *here.*

You can of course clone/copy any of this, but we have no idea why you'd want to.
